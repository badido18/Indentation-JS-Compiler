# Indentation-JS-Compiler

# Quick Introduction 

This is a kind of an **interpreated syntax** derived from JS rather than a new language 
Lasy to open brackets and reorder them 
you like python syntax (like me) with indentations
this tools is made for you ! (and me for sure :p) 
look attentively to this description before using it
> i used compiler rather than script to make in highlight *the concept of a new syntax* 

# Getting started

easy guide to start using JSI the syntax

### Setting parameters

You can find in the *compiler.py*
```Python
#Here Put your file name
YourFileName = "test.jsi"
'''needs to be in .JSI format'''
YourOutputFileName = "result.js"
'''needs to be in .JS format'''
```


### Compilation

After setting your files
just be in the same path as your files and type in the terminal
```powershell
python compiler.py
```

# Syntax 

Good news ! Same syntax as JS dont be lost 
use colon ":" instead of opening brackets
and use indetations "\t" to 

### Important To know

* "::" for object in an object 
> look at the example  below

* When using arrow functions in perenthese "()" the closing parenthese ")" should be in a diffrent line than the last instruction of the scope
> example using map() function below 

* Be sure that your **tab** caracter in your text editor is set to **4 Four spaces** 
> this is required so the compiler can work

### Syntax Errors

You can notice your errors in the generated JS file and fix it 
So , you already get it , the syntax errors related with JS are the same in JSI

> if you find an issue related with the compiler and  not with your JS code 
**Please submit this issue**
